# DD1351 Logic for Computer Scientists

Introduction to mathematical logic and its use within computer science, including logic programming.

- Labb2: Develop and implement an algorithm that is capable of verifying the accuracy and validity of a proof written in natural deduction. 
- Labb3: Design and develop a programmatic tool that is capable of verifying the validity of a temporal logical formula φ within a specific state S in a provided model M.


## Course contents

A. Propositional logic

- Informal mathematical argumentation
- Formal proof techniques: natural deduction
- Syntax and semantics
- Soundness, completeness and decidability

B. Predicate logic

- Syntax and semantics, Kripke structures
- Proof techniques: natural deduction
- Soundness, completeness and undecidability, GÃ¶del's theorems

C. Prolog

- Resolution and logic programming: unification, backtracking, negation, intersection and box diagrams

D. Inductive proof

- Mathematical and complete induction
- Inductive definitions and structural induction

E. Temporal logic

- Syntax and semantics
- Proof techniques: model checking

F. Hoare logic

- Program semantics and specification
- Program verification
- Syntax and semantics: Kripke structures
- Proof techniques: model checking


## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, the students should be able to:

- specify general properties of mathematical-computational structures and prove these by means of natural deduction in propositional logic and predicate logic,
- specify inductive definitions of data structures and prove these with structural induction,
- specify and prove system properties by means of temporal logic,
- specify and prove program properties by means of Hoare logic,
- apply methods for automatic deduction and carry out simple proofs with model checking,
- apply and explain basic concepts in logic programming: unification, backtracking, intersection, negation and different programming techniques such as generate-test

in order to:

- master the proof techniques that are needed in future courses in the education.
